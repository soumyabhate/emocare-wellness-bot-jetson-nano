## 🆕 Updates: Facial Emotion Detection (Jetson Nano)

EmoCare has been extended with **real-time facial emotion detection** using a webcam, designed to run efficiently on **edge devices such as NVIDIA Jetson Nano**.

### 🔍 What’s Added
EmoCare uses lightweight, ONNX-based computer vision models for real-time facial emotion detection, optimized for edge devices:
- Live **face detection** using **OpenCV YuNet (ONNX)**
- **Facial emotion classification** using the **FER+ ONNX model**
- Emotion label + confidence score displayed on the camera feed
- Largest detected face is selected for emotion inference (more stable results)
Both models run locally on-device using OpenCV’s DNN module, ensuring low latency, privacy preservation, and compatibility with NVIDIA Jetson Nano.

### 😊 Detected Emotions (FER+)
- neutral
- happiness
- surprise
- sadness
- anger
- disgust
- fear
- contempt

### ⚙️ Jetson-Friendly Optimizations
- Emotion inference runs **every 5 frames** (reduces compute load)
- Camera resolution capped at **640×480**
- Uses **V4L2 backend** for better USB webcam compatibility
- Requests **MJPEG** stream when supported
- Stores last emotion to avoid flicker between inference frames
- Camera runs in **time-limited sessions** and releases resources automatically

### 📁 Required Models
Place the following files inside a `models/` folder:

```text
models/
├── face_detection_yunet_2023mar.onnx
└── emotion-ferplus-8.onnx
```

🔒 Privacy Note

All emotion inference happens locally on-device. No camera frames are uploaded or stored by EmoCare.

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> ⚠️ Requires **ffmpeg** to be installed for `ffmpeg-python`

### 3️⃣ Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=sk_...
```

**API Usage**
- `GROQ_API_KEY` → Core conversational LLM logic

## 🐛 Troubleshooting & Solutions

| Problem Encountered | Solution |
|-------------------|----------|
| **ElevenLabs TTS Output Stream** | SDK sometimes returns a generator instead of bytes. Fixed using:<br>`b"".join(chunk for chunk in audio_result)` |
| **ElevenLabs STT Model ID** | Transcription failed with generic IDs. Explicitly used **`scribe_v1`**, optimized for STT |
| **sounddevice Device Selection** | Stored device IDs in `st.session_state` and set:<br>`sd.default.device = (input_id, output_id)` |
| **Streamlit Button Reruns** | Required immediate state updates and `st.rerun()` for UI step transitions |

## 🖼️ UI & Response Examples

### 💬 EmoCare Response Example

**User (Voice):**  
> *"I feel like I have too much on my plate this week. My boss gave me two huge deadlines and I haven't slept well."*

**EmoCare:**  
> *"That sounds like a heavy load to carry right now. It’s completely understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed and losing sleep. Your worth isn’t tied to productivity. Could you try one small act of self‑care — maybe stepping away for 90 seconds and stretching? Is there one meeting you could postpone or one small task you could delegate to give yourself a little more room to breathe?"*

### 🧭 Action Compass Example

When the user selects **Stressed / Overwhelmed**, EmoCare highlights:

```html
<div class="compass-swatch active">
  <b>Stressed</b> → 🏃 Move your body – even 60 seconds counts
</div>
```
